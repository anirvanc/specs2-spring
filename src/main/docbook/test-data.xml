            Before we explore the intricacies of the code involved in testing large systems, we need to explore
			what we mean by <emphasis>large system</emphasis>. In what we call large systems, there are many components
			that need to be tested and those components depend on many other Java EE components. Moreover, the structure
			of the code should be as <emphasis>elegant</emphasis> and <emphasis>flexible</emphasis> as possible, without
			imposing technical restrictions.

		<para>Let's take a quick detour to explore the structure of large Spring applications. Enterprise [Spring] applications
		are usually made up of modules; in the smallest applications, these modules represent the tiers. The application
		is then simple packaging of these modules. Let's start with a small application that consists of four such modules.
		We have the <code>domain</code>, <code>repository</code>, <code>services</code> and the <code>webapp</code>.
